# TypeScript

TypeScript is a **strongly typed superset of [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript)** developed by Microsoft. It adds **static typing, interfaces, and modern ES features**, making [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript) development more robust and maintainable. TypeScript code compiles to plain [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript), ensuring compatibility with browsers and Node.js.

## Key Features
- **Static Typing**: Detects type errors during development.
- **Interfaces & Generics**: Improves code structure and reusability.
- **Modern JavaScript Support**: Supports ES6+ features with backward compatibility.
- **Enhanced Code Maintainability**: Helps prevent runtime errors.

## Example Code

```
function greet(name: string): string {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
console.log(greet("TypeScript"));
```

TypeScript is widely used in frameworks like [Angular](/wiki/Angular) and enhances scalability in large projects.
