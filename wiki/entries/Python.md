# Python

Python is a high-level, general-purpose [programming language](/wiki/programming%20language). Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

Python is a programming language that can be used both for writing **command-line scripts** or building **web applications**.
