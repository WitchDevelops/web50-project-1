## Features

Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages. The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements.
