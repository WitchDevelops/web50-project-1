# Programming language

A **programming language** is a system of notation for writing computer programs. Programming languages are described in terms of their **syntax** (form) and **semantics** (meaning), usually defined by a formal language. Languages usually provide features such as a type system, variables, and mechanisms for error handling. An implementation of a programming language is required in order to execute programs, namely an **interpreter** or a **compiler**. An interpreter directly executes the source code, while a compiler produces an executable program.

Computer architecture has strongly influenced the design of programming languages, with the most common type (imperative languagesâ€”which implement operations in a specified order) developed to perform well on the popular von Neumann architecture. While early programming languages were closely tied to the hardware, over time they have developed more abstraction to hide implementation details for greater simplicity.

Some programming languages include:
