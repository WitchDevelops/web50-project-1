# ECMAScript

ECMAScript (ES) is the standardized scripting language specification on which [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript) is based. It defines the core features and syntax of JavaScript and is maintained by TC39, the technical committee behind JavaScriptâ€™s evolution.

## Key Versions

- **ES5 (2009)**: Introduced strict mode and JSON support.
- **ES6 (2015)**: Brought major improvements like `let`/`const`, arrow functions, classes, and template literals.
- **ES7+ (2016 and beyond)**: Added features like async/await, optional chaining, and destructuring.

## Example Code (ES6+)

```
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(sum(3, 5)); // Outputs: 8
```
